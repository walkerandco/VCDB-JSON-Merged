# VCDB-JSON-Merged
This is a JSON file collating together all Verizon's VERISDB (VCDB) json incident files for easier file manipulation. This has been provided so that users can obtain a single JSON array of all of the VCDB data more easily.

The reason for this collation is to support data analysis which requires all of the incidents to be held in a json array within a single json file. Examples of this include Tableau Public.

The original project is at: https://github.com/vz-risk/VCDB

# Regularity of Updates
This collated JSON data file will be updated quarterly.
