# VCDB-JSON-Merged
This is a JSON file collating together all Verizon's VERISDB (VCDB) json incident files for easier file manipulation. This has been provided so that users can obtain a single JSON array of all of the VCDB data more easily.

The reason for this collation is to support data analysis which requires all of the incidents to be held in a json array within a single json file. Examples of this include Tableau Public.

The original project is at: https://github.com/vz-risk/VCDB

# Motivation
I am a cybersecurity researcher at the Manchester Metropolitan University. I made a single JSON file so that I could use it in Tableau Public to product data visualisations for my research publications.

# Regularity of Updates
This collated JSON data file will be updated quarterly.

# Contact
Users can feel free to contact me with issues or suggestions by raising them on this GitHub pages as issues.
